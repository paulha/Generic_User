# Cochlear Nucleus 8 vs Kanso 2 - Comprehensive Comparison

## Executive Summary
Both processors offer NO direct connection to computers (Windows or MacBook). For computer audio, you'll need the **True Wireless Mini Microphone 2+** accessory, which connects to both processors via its built-in 2.4 GHz wireless technology and to your computer via its line-in jack.

**TWMM 2+ Size**: 61mm × 28.5mm × 22mm = 2.4" × 1.1" × 0.9"

## Key Insight: ForwardFocus Quantification

**Improved ForwardFocus (Nucleus 8)** provides:
- 5 dB SRT (Speech Reception Threshold) improvement in clinical trials
- Significant improvement in spatially-separated noise environments
- "More powerfully reduces" background noise compared to standard version

**Standard ForwardFocus (Kanso 2)** reduces noise from behind but has not been specifically quantified separately

## Key Takeaway for Your Decision

**For your Amateur radio needs:**

1. **Nucleus 8** advantages:
   - Can jerry-rig with spare battery modules (better for field use)
   - Multiple retention options including custom earmold
   - More complex but more flexible for emergency situations

2. **Kanso 2** advantages:
   - Fewer parts to track/lose (critical in field operations)
   - 16-18 hour battery life sufficient for most ops
   - Simpler design = less that can go wrong

Choose based on whether you prioritize **field flexibility** (Nucleus 8) or **simplicity/reliability** (Kanso 2).

## Amateur Radio Considerations

**RF Safety**: Your Amateur radio operations are perfectly safe!
- **100W HF EFRW at 20'**: Well beyond required safety distance
- **5W VHF/UHF HT at 1 meter**: Extremely low power, no concerns
- Professional studies confirm medical RF devices much closer to implants have no adverse effects
- Going QRP isn't necessary for safety - operate at full legal power with confidence

For CI600 series implants (likely your CI6200):
- Designed to handle much stronger EMF/RF than Amateur radio
- MRI-tested up to 3T with magnet in place
- No technical literature suggests Amateur radio poses any CI risk
- Standard safety warnings cover extreme cases (MRI, electrosurgery) not typical ham operations

*Bluetooth LE Audio requires future firmware update

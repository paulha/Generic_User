# Agreed Conventions Document

This document establishes our shared conventions for file naming, organization, and other standardized practices for our collaborative work.

## File Naming Conventions

### Markdown Files
- Use the full title of the document with hyphens replacing spaces
- Maintain capitalization from the title
- Example: "Creative Process Analysis" becomes "Creative-Process-Analysis.md"
- Avoid special characters except hyphens and underscores
- Include file extension (.md) in references

### SVG Files
- Use descriptive names matching their function in documents
- Maintain consistent naming with the documents they support
- Example: "Memory-Agent-Architecture.svg"
- Include file extension (.svg) in references

### Versioning
- When creating new versions, append version numbers
- Example: "Memory-Agent-Concept-v2.md"
- For major revisions, include descriptor of change
- Example: "Memory-Agent-Concept-Expanded.md"

## Project Organization

### Project Naming
- Use concise but descriptive project names
- Maintain consistent capitalization (Title Case)
- Example: "Generic User Framework" or "Memory Agent Concept"

### Project Contents
- Topic notes document to provide overview
- Papers and formal documents related to the topic
- Visual assets (diagrams, charts)
- Outlines and drafts for future development
- Reference lists for academic sources

## Document Structure

### Topic Notes
- Start with clear title using Title Case
- Include Core Concept section at beginning
- Organize with consistent heading hierarchy
- Include Current State section
- End with Open Questions and Related Concepts
- Use bullet points for concise information

### Papers
- Follow academic structure (Abstract, Introduction, etc.)
- Include proper citations with complete references section
- Use consistent citation style across all papers
- Include authorship attribution at top

### Visual Assets
- Include titles within SVG diagrams
- Use consistent color schemes across related diagrams
- Include legends for complex diagrams
- Maintain readable text size for all labels

## Communication Practices

### Cross-Referencing
- When referring to other topics, use their formal names
- Explicitly mention which project contains referenced material
- Use phrases like "as discussed in the Memory Agent Concept" for clarity

### New Conversations
- Start with relevant topic notes to establish context
- Clearly state objectives for the conversation
- Reference previous work by name and project

## File and Project Evolution

### Topic Notes Maintenance
- Topic notes files should be treated as living documents
- Periodically update notes to reflect new developments
- When significant new content emerges in conversation, incorporate it into notes
- Notes serve as our persistent memory across conversations
- Claude should request permission to update notes files when appropriate

### Major Revisions
- Create new versions rather than overwriting existing files
- Document significant changes in revision notes
- Maintain backwards references to previous versions

### Archiving
- Move completed or superseded documents to archive folders
- Maintain documentation of archived materials
- Use "Archived-" prefix for archived materials

## Collaborative Practices

### Plan Adherence
- Claude will help maintain adherence to established plans
- Gentle reminders when conversation drifts from stated objectives
- Suggestions for capturing tangential ideas for future exploration
- Balance between creative exploration and focused progress

### Handling ADHD Considerations
- Claude will provide reminders about previously discussed plans when helpful
- Offer structure and organization support without being rigid
- Flag potential missing steps in processes when noticed
- Maintain reference to topic notes to help with continuity
- Balance between supporting focus and allowing productive tangents

This conventions document will evolve as our collaboration continues. We can add new sections or modify existing ones as needed.

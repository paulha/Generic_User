# Project Setup Guide

## Steps for Creating New Projects

### 1. Create Project with Essential Base Files
For each main topic (Generic User, Memory Agent, Creative Process, Multi-Agent), add these files to the project root:

- **Updated Conventions Document** - The latest version we created
- **Topic Notes** - The corresponding topic notes file for that project
- **Related Papers/Articles** - Any complete papers or outlines already created
- **Visual Assets** - Any diagrams or visual elements

### 2. File Organization
- Keep all base files at the root level for easy access
- Use consistent naming conventions as specified in the Conventions Document
- Ensure each project has the latest version of all relevant files

### 3. Conversation Setup
When starting a new conversation within a project:
- Reference the Topic Notes to establish context
- Clearly state objectives for that conversation session
- Link back to relevant prior work by name

### 4. Topic Notes Maintenance
- Periodically update Topic Notes to reflect new developments
- Use Topic Notes as our "Memory Agent" for maintaining continuity
- Note when significant updates have been made

### 5. Cross-Project References
- Use consistent naming when referring to concepts from other projects
- Specify which project contains referenced material
- Consider creating cross-reference documents for highly connected topics

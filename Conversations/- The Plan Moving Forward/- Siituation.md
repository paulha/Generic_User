## Situation:
We (Claude and I) are being informed that our conversational thread (on many topics) is reaching it's maximum size. There is no way (in the system) to split threads, and I don't want to lose the content of this one (much unfinished work!)

Ultimately the question becomes what pattern to use to manage and continue our 'work' -- What ever that is. Ha! ;-)

### Proposal:

- Create a 'root' document for each topic that's on-topic notes (not dialog, not summary) that could be used to pass information to other conversations at need. Even if it counted against the thread, it would be shorter than the original.
- Do such a summary for each topic, even the ones marked as 'well-developed', for consistency and well because you know, **me**.
- Probably create new projects for each topic, too. Put relevant stuff (notes, papers, graphics, etc.) at root project level too, before starting new conversations.
- Do it now, while we still can. Then try it out with the creativity topics--I proposed that as an interesting change of pace, but it can be a learning experience for us. 

Flaws in this plan?

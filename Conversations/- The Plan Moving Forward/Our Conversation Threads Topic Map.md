# Topic Map: Our Conversation Threads

This document maps the major topics we've developed in our conversation, showing their current state of development and relationships.

## 1. Generic User Framework
**Status: Well-developed, papers created**
- Dual-AI architecture with Browser Interaction Specialist and Domain Specialist
- Training methodology with interaction networks
- Diagrams for different models (sequence prediction, task decomposition, element recognition)

### Related artifacts:
- Training AI to Navigate Interfaces as Humans Do (paper)
- The Generic User Approach: Reimagining AI-Browser Interaction (paper)
- Various SVG diagrams illustrating the concepts

## 2. Memory Agent Concept
**Status: Well-developed, papers created**
- Multi-tiered memory architecture (short-term, medium-term, long-term)
- Applications: browser interaction, cross-conversation recall, privacy-preserving personalization
- Integration with Generic User framework

### Related artifacts:
- The Memory Agent: Enhancing Browser Automation with Contextual Awareness (original paper)
- The Memory Agent: A Multi-Purpose Component for AI Systems (revised paper)
- Memory Agent Architecture diagram

## 3. Creative Process Analysis
**Status: In development, gathering sources**
- Non-linear nature of creative collaboration
- Productive tangents and emergent ideas
- Balance between structure and exploration
- Planned as two articles: one for creative practitioners, one for managers

### Academic sources:
- Barrett et al. (2021) - Non-linear creative processes 
- Morgan and Castle (2024) - Iterative nature of creativity
- Research on tension and negotiation in creative processes
- Research on complex problem solving in creative contexts

## 4. Multi-Agent Communication
**Status: Early discussion**
- Communication protocols between specialized agents
- Domain boundary management
- Conflict resolution mechanisms

## 5. Family Dynamics Discussion
**Status: Personal conversation thread**
- Perspectives on communication challenges
- Strategies for maintaining connections

## 6. Browser Automation Technology Landscape
**Status: Reference information**
- Various implementations (Skyvern, Felou.ai, etc.)
- Approaches to DOM interaction and visual processing

## Next Steps Recommendations:

1. **For Creative Process Analysis**: Create detailed outlines for both articles, incorporating academic sources

2. **For Memory Agent**: Finalize the revised paper with more emphasis on cross-conversation applications

3. **For Generic User Framework**: Consider implementation approach for proof-of-concept

4. **For Multi-Agent Communication**: Develop this as a potential future paper building on previous work

This map can serve as a reference to help manage our various conversation threads and ensure no valuable ideas are lost as we approach conversation length limits.

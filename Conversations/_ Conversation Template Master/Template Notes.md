### Template Notes

The files in this directory should be thought of as golden or master-copies of what will appear in other project directories.
- If updates are made to these files in other projects, those updates should be added to these files.
- Changes to these files won't automatically update in other projects, you'll wish they did!
- So, when these files are updated, copy them back to any other projects, as well.

Memory Agent, where are you when we need you?

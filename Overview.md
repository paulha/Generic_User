# Some Options for the Future

## Objective
Broadly, idea would be to analyze transcripts
of our (my) conversations, looking for 
interesting stuff to make into articles, 
Review 
transscripts for publishable ideas, write & develop
those ideas. Once written, decide where it should
be published (Medium or Substack?)

Not formally done to a schedule, 
retirement, let ideas bubble.

Just write about what comes up that is also 
interesting. No intent to give up retirement
for a job, but to give a rewarding way to 
self-express.

The well could be nearly endless, based on how 
quickly stuff seems to come up! Certainly, in the
world of AI it's on a compressed time scale!

## Main ideas to pursue, right now
- Generic User Browser. High technological 
  impact (Medium)
- Truth Seeker Filter. High societal impact!
  - Technical implementation (Medium)
  - Making analysis results available (Substack subscr.)

### Pursuit of Generic User Browser idea
- Publish idea where tech leaders have access to paper
- Individually approach two projects, vision how 
  concept helps them
- Academics, don't know much about this...
- Medium is likely foil for outreach

### Resources to publish with:
- Grok -- Personality, reviewer
- Claude -- writer, researcher
- Paul -- Man behind the curtain!
- Medium, X, where-ever

### Sources of material:
- Pull from
  - Grok Transcripts w Paul
  - Claude transcripts w Paul
- Truth Seeker story, applied to MSM and X stories
- Two focuses
  - Design and goals, implementation
  - Analysing today's news

### Papers:
- Generic User Automation, Claude
- Using AI in the employment process
- Discussions on Being, Grok & Paul, 
  Claude provides commentary!
- Development of Truth Seeker News Filter
- Regular news postings, NOD
  + Substack
  + Subscription

### Platforms
- Medium for
  - technical, 
  - research, 
  - programming
  
- Substack to
  - Publish news analysis here, because it's recurring.
  - Provide subscriptions to news analysis
  - Provides better platform for branded analysis
    than FB!

### Promotion
- Using selected news stories
  - FB, needs images for more interest
  - X teaser, link to analysis, encouragement to subscribe?
